    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe is for all my soul food lovers. Coming from enjoying soul food at least once a week in my household,
        I feel it's only right to have a soul-food recipe in the recipe book. If you've never tried candied yams I hope
        you try it, I'm sure you'll like it.</p>

    <p>These yams coated in thick syrup are prefect for the holidays, sweet and delightful. Top with a dash of cinnamon
        if you like!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>You got this. This one is easy!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>4 sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <p>Direction, not directions. Just one step please don't let me down</p>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>

    <p>In a large pot over medium heat, place potatoes in water. Top with butter and sugar, cover and bring to a boil.
        Reduce heat to low and simmer, without stirring, until mixture is thick and syrupy, 40 minutes. Mixture will
        thicken slightly as it cools. Remove from heat and serve warm.
