# Project: Recipes
This project is a basic recipe website built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). It includes a homepage with links to individual recipe pages, each containing a description, ingredients, and steps for cooking. The project focuses on practicing basic HTML structure, links, and content organization.
